extends RefCounted

# Per-kind ability loadout table (PRD #518 / tracer slice #533). One place
# answers "which archetypes does this enemy compose, tuned how", so giving an
# enemy a new move is a data change here rather than a new AI class.
#
# Keyed on kind AND is_boss because BossRoster reuses ROGUE_ROOMBA as the
# floor-1 Vacuum: the standard roomba keeps its own moves, the Vacuum composes
# Pull + Telegraphed charge.
#
# Exhaustive over EnemyKind, mirroring EnemyBehavior.for_kind. Kinds whose
# archetype conversion lands in later issues (#534-#545) answer with a single
# LegacyBehaviorAbility standing for "this kind's existing bespoke behavior
# already drives its moves" — the list is never empty, so the Enemy node's
# generic pump always has something to drive and never needs a per-kind branch.

# The Vacuum (floor 1). Pull teaches spacing, the telegraphed charge teaches
# sidestepping. Wind-ups are long relative to the player's 60 px/s walk so both
# are beatable on foot — the PRD forbids leaning on a dash the game never gave.
