class_name DungeonLayout
extends RefCounted

# Pure-data product of DungeonLayoutEngine.compute(). Holds the spatial
# embedding of a dungeon graph: a grid position per room id and the list of
# directed corridor edges. No scene-tree references — the rendering layer
# (multi-room tilemap, exit door placement) consumes this.

var room_positions: Dictionary = {}
var corridors: Array = []

# Map a grid position to a world pixel origin. The renderer adds room-local
# offsets on top of this. `room_size` is the room's tile-span in pixels;
# `corridor_width` is the gap between rooms used for the connecting corridor.
